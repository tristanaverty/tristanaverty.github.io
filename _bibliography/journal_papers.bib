	abstract={Most natural matrices that incorporate information about a graph are the adjacency and the Laplacian matrices. These algebraic representations govern the fundamental concepts and tools in graph signal processing even though they reveal information in different ways. Furthermore, in the context of spectral graph classification, the problem of cospectrality may arise and it is not well handled by these matrices. Thus, the question of finding the best graph representation matrix still stands. In this letter, a new family of representations that well captures information about graphs and also allows to find the standard representation matrices, is introduced. This family of unified matrices well captures the graph information and extends the recent works of the literature. Two properties are proven, namely its positive semidefiniteness and the monotonicity of their eigenvalues. Reported experimental results of spectral graph classification highlight the potential and the added value of this new family of matrices, and evidence that the best representation depends upon the structure of the underlying graph.},

	title={Hurst exponent estimation using natural visibility graph embedding in Fisherâ€“Shannon plane},

	abstract={In this article, two important stochastic processes, namely fractional Brownian motions (fBm) and fractional Gaussian noises (fGn) are analyzed, within a Fisher-Shannon framework. These processes are well suited for the realistic modeling of phenomena occurring across various domains in science and engineering. An unique feature that characterizes both fBm and fGn, is the Hurst parameter \(H\), that measures the long/short range dependence of such stochastic processes. In this paper, we show that these processes, from which we extract the degree distribution of the associated natural visibility graph (NVG), can be located in an informational plane, defined by normalized Shannon entropy \(S\)~and Fisher information measure \(F\), in order to estimate their Hurst exponents. The aim of this work is to map signals onto this informational plane, in which a reference backbone is built using generated fBm and fGn processes with known Hurst exponents. To show the effectiveness of the developed graphical estimator, some real-world data are analyzed, and it found that the \(H\)~estimated by our method are quite comparable to those obtained from four well-known estimators of the literature. Besides, estimation of \(H\)~parameter is very fast and requires a reduced number of samples of the input signal. Using the constructed reference backbone in the Fisher-Shannon plane, the associated \(H\)~exponent can be easily estimated by a simple orthogonal projection of the point \((S, F)\)~extracted from the truncated degree distribution of the considered signal NVG representation.},
