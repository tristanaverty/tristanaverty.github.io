**Topic** : MUSIT is an international and interdisciplinary project that transforms heterogeneous tracking sensor data into complete, semantically enriched trajectories, opening new perspectives in mobility monitoring and establishing a dynamic network of collaborations among academia, industry, and innovators.

**Funding** : MUSIT has received funding from the European Union's HORIZON-MSCA-2023-SE-01 program under grant agreement No 101182585.

We are thrilled to introduce "**MMDEC: Multimodal Maritime Dataset on the English Channel**", a dataset created within the European MUSIT MSCA Staff Exchanges (HORIZON) EU Project whose main goal is to integrate and refine data from heterogeneous sources in order to reconstruct and enhance (maritime) trajectories.

##### 🧭 ***[Click to explore the dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17491518)***

<br>

You'll find data from various sources and sensors such as:
- 📍 **AIS positions and specifications messages**
- 🛰 **Satellite images and AI detections**

and many others: 

- 🤿 Bathymetry
- 🌦️ Meteorology
- 🌊 Oceanography
- ⚓️ Ports locations
- 🐠 Marine protected areas
- 🌪️ Wind farms
- 🛟 French maritime operations
- 📞 Telecommunication and power cables
- 🛣️ Traffic Separation Schemes
 
🌍 **Area of Interest**: western Celtic Sea, English Channel, and a part of the North Sea

⏱️ **Time period**: from July 1, 2023, to October 1, 2023

🤝 This work is the result of a collaboration between **École navale — Institut de Recherche et d'Études Navales** and **Nodalpoint Systems** with, as collaborators,
- Ioannis Nasios,
- Cyril Ray, 
- Nikolaos Piliouras.
