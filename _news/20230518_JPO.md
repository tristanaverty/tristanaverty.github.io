During the Naval Academy's Journées Portes Ouvertes on Thursday May 18, 2023, I took part in a non-trivial exercise in popularization: 10 minutes to understand neural networks and their potential uses within the Navy. On the program: an activity to understand features extraction, a demystification of artificial intelligence and an awareness of data policy. Visitors to the French Naval Academy Research Institute were even able to test Alpaca 7B, the LLM (Large Language Model) running on a laptop.
