At this second edition of the "French Naval Academy Doctoral Students Day", I had the opportunity to present, in 300 seconds, a scientific popularization of my 3-year thesis carried out at the French Naval Academy Research Institute. I was awarded first prize by the jury, but not without a fight, as the competition with my fellow doctoral students was fierce, given the equally excellent quality of their work.

Over and above the award, I realize how fortunate I am to benefit from such a environment, with its constant proximity to the operational world, and the importance of technical and human resources in living out one's vocation and combining teaching and cutting-edge research for the benefit of the French Navy.
