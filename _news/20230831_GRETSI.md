The GRETSI colloquium has exceptionally met two years in a row, and after the two posters presented last year in Nancy, I had the chance to present, in Grenoble, our paper entitled ***"Sur la similarité spectrale des graphes par mesure de corrélation"*** (co-authored with Delphine Daré-Emzivat and Abdel Boudraa). This paper presents a new graph representation matrix and a new similarity measure for graph and signal classification, the latter being of magnetic origin for underwater object detection. I'm proud to have been able to represent the French Naval Academy Research Institute at this conference.
