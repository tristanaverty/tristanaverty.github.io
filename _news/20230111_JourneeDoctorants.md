I took part in the French Naval Academy Doctoral Students Day on January 11, 2023, where the aim was to present my work, in 300 seconds, to researchers, Academy members and military personnel from other operational areas of the French Navy. It was a very good exercise in popularization, which opened the doors to other departments, as well as bringing me closer to researchers in the field of organizational resilience.
