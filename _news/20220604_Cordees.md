["Cordées de la réussite"](https://www.cordeesdelareussite.fr) aims to make career guidance a real lever for equal opportunity. Their aim is to combat self-censorship and encourage students' academic ambitions through a continuum of support from 4th grade through to high school and university. The project I supervised was entitled:

After an oral presentation and a poster presented by the students, this work won the **Best Project Award**.
