Passionate about science and technology, but more particularly about mathematics and its applications in signal processing (audio, underwater acoustics), I am also interested in new machine learning methods such as Deep Learning for image and signal processing.

Born of a mathematics professor mother and a military father, science and defense are two areas deeply rooted in me. That's why I managed to carve out a not-so-narrow path between these two fields by becoming a **Teaching and Research Assistant** at the French Naval Academy.

Teacher in automatic control, image processing and artificial intelligence, I am also writing my thesis at the interface between signal processing, graph theory and machine learning entitled :

> [***"On representation matrices of graphs: Application to structural and spectral classification"***](https://www.theses.fr/s280140)

I made the following video for the EDSML Doctoral Students Days in November 2022 to present (in 3') this thesis work:

In my spare time, you'll probably find me hiking or paddling near the Crozon peninsula, an area I've come to love for its history and geography.
