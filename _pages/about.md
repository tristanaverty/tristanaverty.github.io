Passionate about science and technology, but more particularly about mathematics and its applications in signal processing (audio, underwater acoustics), I am also interested in new machine learning methods such as Deep Learning for image and signal processing.

Born of a mathematics professor mother and a military father, science and defense are two areas deeply rooted in me. That's why I managed to carve out a not-so-narrow path between these two fields by becoming a **Teaching and Research Assistant** at the French Naval Academy.

Teacher in system control, image processing and artificial intelligence, I am also writing my thesis at the interface between signal processing, graph theory and machine learning entitled :

> [***"Matrices de représentation généralisées, mesures spectrales et distances statistiques pour l’analyse et la classification de graphes et de signaux"***](./phd_thesis)
